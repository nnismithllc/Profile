        <p class="card-text"> Have you ever wondered about living a life of accomplishing dreams through a tainted lens, then you have just been introduced to me. My name is Tia Smith and I express the journey of life from a perspective of optimism. I was born and raised in Detroit, MI. Graduated from University of Michigan, then 4 years later went back to Henry Ford College to change careers, then 1 year later received my ceritificate from Real Estate School. <br> <br> I love education, reading, traveling, and screenwriting. My passions came from my youth. I always had a hard time finding words to express myself. I had always dreamed of living life outside the box; accomplishing goals that people are afraid to achieve. Once I gained my credentials, there was always a hidden element inside me that I couldn't define. Something unordinary was trying to unleash the beauty within me. Thats when I became a believer in Christ. After years of devotion, I become the Founder of Faithful 15 Single Ministry. My Ministry aims to unlock the mysteries of singleness by educating members about faithfulness and devotion to God while their single. I am forever striving to unveil the "me" the world is waiting on. Check out my social media pages for more details.</p>
